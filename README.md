# Skeleton Framework

The Skeleton Framework is two things, principally:

A simple toolkit of responsive css for mobile first development. Skeleton
really shines when used as a foundation for your project's own styles.

A [curated list](https://github.com/skeleton-framework/bones) of small, self contained, well made components that either
play well with the core Skeleton CSS out of the box, or have been made to do so
with a simple shim of CSS.

Skeleton Framework takes its roots from
[dhg/Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton), and builds upon the same basic
principles.
