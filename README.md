# Skeleton Framework

The Skeleton Framework is two things, principally:

A simple toolkit of responsive css for mobile first development. Skeleton really
shines when used as a foundation for your project's own styles.

A [curated list](/) of small, self contained, well made components that either play
well with the core Skeleton CSS out of the box, or have been made to do so with
a simple shim of CSS.


Skeleton Framework takes its roots from
[dhg/Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton), and builds upon the same basic
principles.
